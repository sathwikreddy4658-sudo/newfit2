# Supabase Support Follow-up Template (Urgent Data Loss)

Subject: URGENT - Request immediate restore for deleted/disabled project/account

Hello Supabase Support Team,

I am following up on my urgent ticket regarding a deleted/disabled account/project.

## Account and Project Details
- Account email: <your-email>
- Organization name: <org-name>
- Project reference(s): <project-ref(s)>
- Approximate time first noticed (UTC): <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC>
- Plan/Billing details: <plan + billing identifier>

## Business Impact
- Production impact: <outage / critical degraded>
- Data affected: schemas, tables, functions, webhooks, storage, auth users (if applicable)
- Urgency: critical

## Restore Request
Please perform an immediate attempt to recover:
1. Database state (schemas + data) from latest available backup/PITR
2. Storage buckets and files/objects
3. Auth users and auth configuration (if recoverable)
4. Edge Functions and function secrets/configuration (if recoverable)

## Requested Recovery Target
- Preferred restore point timestamp (UTC): <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC>
- If exact timestamp unavailable, restore to nearest latest consistent point.

## Verification Requested From Support
Please confirm for me:
- Which components were recovered successfully
- What could not be recovered (if any)
- Retention/backups available for my project tier
- Any additional steps I must do post-restore (key rotation, config updates)

Thank you for urgent assistance. Please mark this as highest priority due to production data loss.
